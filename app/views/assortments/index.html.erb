  <p class='w-2/3 explainer-text'>Group tags together with Assortments. Say you have a bunch of notes with a tag about your work in progress called <span class='tags'>#new-book</span>. You might also have a source associated with that tag, plus one called <span class='tags'>#read</span>, so you can add something to your reading list about <span class='tags'>#new-book</span>.</p>
  <br/>
  <p class='w-2/3 explainer-text'>Instead of just searching the <span class='tags'>#read</span> tag and digging for all the related <span class='tags'>#new-book</span> tags, you can sort both tags into a single Assortment. This assortment is automatically added to any writing project which uses the <span class='tags'>#new-book</span> tag.</p>
