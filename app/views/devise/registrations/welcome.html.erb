  <blockquote>
    Writing a novel is a terrible experience, during which the hair often falls out and the teeth decay. 
    I'm always irritated by people who imply that writing fiction is an escape from reality. 
    It is a plunge into reality and it's very shocking to the system. - Flannery O'Connor
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    "She wished there was some place where she could go to hum it out loud. 
    Some kind of music was too private to sing in a house cram fall of people. 
    It was funny, too, how lonesome a person could be in a crowded house." 
    - <em>The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter</em> by Carson McCullers
