      <ul class="text-align-center mt-4">
        <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/highlighter-online/">Highlighter for Firefox</a></li>
        <li class="mt-4"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/highlighter/jhbdfidbplpijoncnlfooepldoleioga">Highlighter for Chrome</a></li>
      </ul>
    <p class="mt-4">The browser extension you just downloaded supplements this web app (<a href='https://highlighter.online'>highlighter.online</a>). The username and password you just created is used for both. Any highlight you save with your extension is available at this web app. 
    <p class="mt-4">You've already created your account, but you're only logged into <a href='https://highlighter.online'>highlighter.online</a> and <strong>not the Highlighter browser extension you just downloaded.</strong> So now you need to log into the extension. </p>

    <h2 class="text-center text-xl font-bold box-header py-2">Log in to the extension</h2>
    <p class="mt-4">
      At the top right corner of your browser, click the purple logo that says "Hi" and enter the username and password you created earlier.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">Once you've logged into the popup successfully, you can now save your highlights.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">
    Select text with your cursor, right click, and choose "Save Highlight".
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">Test it out with some quotes:</p>
    <blockquote class="mt-4">
      It is certain, in any case, that ignorance, allied with power, is the most ferocious enemy justice can have. - James Baldwin
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="mt-4">
      "She wished there was some place where she could go to hum it out loud. 
      Some kind of music was too private to sing in a house cram fall of people. 
      It was funny, too, how lonesome a person could be in a crowded house." 
      - <em>The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter</em> by Carson McCullers

    <p class="mt-4">Much like you'd "highlight" text on a piece of paper, this action saves the highlight to a database so you can reference it later. You can access all of your highlights on the <a href='https://highlighter.online'>highlighter.online</a> web app (the website where you're reading this).</p>
    <p class="mt-4">Any highlight you create will be visible in the popup whenever you visit the webpage from where the highlight originated.</p>
