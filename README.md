# highlighter
This rails app saves "highlights", aka selected passages of text, while reading online. The highlights are sent from this Chrome browser extension: https://github.com/smcalilly/highlighter-chrome

The Chrome client authenticates to the Rails API with a JWT. The user's data is siloed and independent of other users' data.
