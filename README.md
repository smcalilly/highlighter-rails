# highlighter
this rails app saves "highlights" or selected passages while reading on the internet. the highlights are sent from this chrome browser extension: https://github.com/smcalilly/highlighter-chrome

i'm currently adding a jwt authentication system so a user can save the highlight from the chrome client to an account in the rails app.
