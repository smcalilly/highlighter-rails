# highlighter
this rails app saves "highlights" or selected passages while reading on the internet. the highlights are sent from this chrome browser extension: https://github.com/smcalilly/highlighter-chrome-basic

i recently added jwt authentication system so a user can save the highlight from the chrome client to an account in the rails app. need to change the client authentication to a more secure setup via omniauth.
